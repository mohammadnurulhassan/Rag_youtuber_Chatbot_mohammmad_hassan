# Youtuber RAG Chatbot – Data Engineering Knowledge Assistantmmad_hassan

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built for data engineering learning content.
The chatbot answers questions based on my own YouTube lecture transcriptions and notes, stored as Markdown files.

It combines vector search with LLM reasoning and is deployed with Azure Function App support.
