Storing the data into dtb. Basically it's doing ELT inside and the data is stored in dtb. And then afterwards what you can do is to connect a Streamlet application, of course, and that I have shown in previous videos as well.\\n\\nHere I will just, put in the STREAMLET code that you can see a front end of this. And then afterwards we will go to the main point of this video, which is to dockerize it. We'll containerize the whole data pipeline. And that is really cool because when you have containerized it, ~~it's in ~~it will work in every system.\\n\\nYou don't need to be dependent on. Particular parts of installations, et cetera. The idea is that when this works locally in my [00:01:00] computer very well, then I can easily just deploy it up into Azure and then Azure or a VS or Google Cloud platform or somewhere else. It's it should work as well.\\n\\nAnd and that is really cool. What we'll do here and focus on in this video is to dockerize this.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-1:** I've copied over the folders that I had in the previous lecture. It means that we have our data extract load for DLT. We have data transformation where we have DBT and we have data warehouse, which is this job ads Duck db. And then we have orchestration, which is the Dexter. What we need to do now is a new terminal.\\n\\nAnd I will activate my virtual environment. ~~It's, I already activated. ~~I see. We'll go into orchestration and here I will run Dexter dev dash F definitions [00:02:00] and we can see that this is running our texter web server. Yes. I can click on this Dexter web server and you can see it running here. This is my Dexter web server, and you can see the assets here.\\n\\nYou can see the lineage. This is basically the lineage, okay? And the idea is that now I'm running this in local host, as you can see, local host 3000. ~~But I will close this down. ~~I will close this down. With Ctrl C, the idea is that we want to dockerize this. I want to dockerize this together with Dockerizing the Streamlet app.\\n\\nFor doing that, I will start with pasting in my Streamlet application. Then we will create a. Dashboard here. Another folder, dashboard, and the streamlet application is very simple. I'll just copy these files in here. [00:03:00] From my lecture notes and you can see here, connect Data Warehouse.\\n\\nBasically what it does is that it goes into our DB path OS dot get, NV duck DB path. That means we will go in and create a dot e NV here and we will see what it's called, duck DB path. And this is basically the path to my duck db.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-2:** I choose to write this path here, data warehouse slash job ads db, just to see that we can run it locally. ~~Because why do I do this? ~~Because in this connection now I've also added this from DV import Low DNV and low d nv. That is because we will go here and take the O os, get the NV that we get this ENV path.\\n\\nThis duct D Buff. Here we'll take from do NV now, but later on we'll send this into a dock. We'll dockerize this. We will send in [00:04:00] environment variable and we will change the path as well. We can see that I'm you not using PFL here, I can remove that one. And here you can see this is basically just a convenience function that we can connect to DDB and then do the query basically.\\n\\nAnd then we have a dashboard here. And the dashboard is basically a Stream IT app that is very simple. We have simple layout, and then we run the layout basically like that. And in order to run this, we actually need to be in in the root folder because how I specified this path. I specified it as data warehouse, job ads, tech db, to run this one stream, lead, run dashboard.\\n\\nDashboard pi. Now I have run this one and you can see it works. That, that the reason why we choose I choose this path is because and why I choose to run it [00:05:00] from outside is that when I run it from the root here~~ it will go in will, ~~it will have the path to dockerize data pipeline.\\n\\nAnd then slash and then it adds this path here. We go into data warehouse, we go into job ads, ddb, and this is then the absolute path that is used here for this query for this DDB dot Connect, that we can connect to this data warehouse, this TB file. Okay, that is basically how we run it locally.\\n\\nNow we will try to dockerize this and to dockerize this. We start with creating a few docker files. I will have this in the root. I'll call this docker file.data warehouse because here I will~~ use I will ~~dockerized the data warehouse. Or dockerize basically the [00:06:00] pipeline to create this dashboard.\\n\\nOr the pipeline to ingest the data to transform the data. Basically it's the the one that will create this DDB database. And then we will create one ~~for ~~for the Streamlet application. ~~We'll have one other one. ~~We'll have docker file dot dashboard. This is for the stream list application.\\n\\nAnd here from Python three point 11 slim in. And then ENV. We choose which environment variable. We choose the D DB path. Equals to slash data warehouse slash job ads Duck bb. This is what we send in. Now you can see that okay. This is in [00:07:00] the root of our Docker container.\\n\\nWe have this data warehouse folder, and inside that we have this job, ads Tech db. And then we'll have work directory is in slash app slash dashboard. This is our work directory and we'll just copy our dashboard folder. This one will copy this folder dashboard into our into our slash app.\\n\\nSlash dashboard. We just copy it in. And then we also need to run pip install Streamlet duck db, and Pandas ~~to ~~to run ~~this this ~~this streamlet application. Let's see. Do I need, yeah, I need Titan dash NV as well. In case we use the dot d nv and then command when I spin up this container, I wanted to run this [00:08:00] stream, it run dashboard dot pi\\n\\nserver port equals 85 0 1.\\n\\nDash server address is the local host, 0.0 0.0 0.0\\n\\nbasically like this. And then ~~we will have our ~~we will have our dashboard. ~~It, we, ~~we will orchestrate this with Docker compose that we'll have both this Docker file dashboard and this docker file data warehouse that they will be run. And then ~~we, ~~for, to do that, we'll create a docker dash compost yamo.\\n\\nAnd here we'll have version let's see, 3.9. Actually, I don't think this is needed. Services data warehouse, [00:09:00] pipeline build and context. Okay. The context is dot. And then Docker file will choose the docker file we want. Docker file dot actually I can remove this fast. We'll start with just to show you that it works.\\n\\n~~We'll go into, ~~it's inside of services. I'll go into dashboard first and build.\\n\\nBuild context dots. It means that we'll go into this let me just remove~~ data where, ~~remove this one. ~~Okay. ~~Context that we'll look into this folder here which the dot means. And then docker file will choose docker file dot dashboard. We'll choose here dockerfile dot dashboard, this one, and inside here we'll have volumes.\\n\\nWe'll have [00:10:00] volumes. Is this dot slash data. Warehouse colon slash data warehouse ro.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-3:** Okay, RO means read only. Here we have our dashboard. Let me see. We have this data warehouse, we send it, we take this data warehouse folder, we send it into this slash data warehouse ~~in ~~in our container. Here we can go into ports. We need to do ports mapping. And we will do 8 5 0 1 2 8 5 0 1.\\n\\nYou can see the local host is 8 5 0 1. Like this. Now we have our dashboard ready, then we just do docker, compose up dash d.\\n\\nAnd we'll see if this one works, because now this one [00:11:00] will run the docker file dashboard and inside there we will run the Streamlet apps. We'll see if this one works. It does a lot of installation now, run people install. You can see first time it takes a little bit of time, yeah, I will close this and yeah, it's finished. Okay, great. Now we should be able to go into local host 8 5 0 1 and run this one. And let me just check. Docker, PS And you can see ~~this one. ~~This one this event chair is running. It's up and you can see this port here. We should be able to just copy this one here and go into our browser and paste it in.\\n\\nAnd you can see this dashboard is up now, and you can see here it's the local host 8 5 0 1. And this is the one that is in our Docker container. Cool. It [00:12:00] works. Okay. I'll just. Do Docker compose down to close this one down. Good. And now it's time for my other service. I'll create my data warehouse service.\\n\\nBut that one is dependent on the stock file data warehouse, I can write it first here. Okay, DDWH pipeline. And here we'll have build and same here. Context is dots and then Docker file. It's the doca file data warehouse. And here we'll have volumes. Let's see, volumes. We'll do a read only bind mount here, and note that this you can do for local development.\\n\\nFor local development we go into our home, we take our DBT slash profiles, [00:13:00] yaman. And then we send this into our pipeline. Pipeline slash profiles, yamo and read only. Okay, let me just yeah, the prettier doesn't work very well here, actually. I hope that this one works. Let's see.\\n\\nVolumes. Maybe I have Misti, something I'm not sure. Volumes we will have another volume here dot slash data warehouse. We send this one into our data warehouse. This we create this data warehouse first this job as Duck db using our using this, and using our what is called Dexter, and then we send this folder into here.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLet's see. But then ports [00:14:00] the ports ~~for ~~for Dexter is 3000. We have 3000 mapping towards 3000. Okay. Let's see if this one will work. The prettier doesn't work here. It doesn't yeah, it doesn't help me to okay. May, maybe I need to do this manually. Okay, better. Let's see, dashboard.\\n\\nActually, this ones need to go in here like this. These are part of the dashboard. Actually the dashboard, we don't need the volumes because we already have it. I think. No, actually not we need to put it in. Yes. Here we have the data warehouse pipeline. I just take like this. We have data warehouse pipeline, we have the dashboard, and this maps 3000 to 3000.\\n\\nWhat remains is the dockerfile for data warehouse. Just ~~write this one and to ~~write this one. We do similar here from Python three point 11 HS three 11. I choose three 11 because I use three [00:15:00] 11 in my system. Otherwise we could choose a ~~new ~~newer version. It doesn't matter. ENV DBT profiles, directory is our slash pipeline\\n\\ndeck, db o equals slash warehouse slash job adsb.\\n\\nThese are the environment variables that we send in that we can use ~~them. ~~We'll have work directory is slash pipeline slash orchestration. This is where we will have our work directory inside of our container, and then we'll copy. Our data, we'll copy everything. Now. Our data extract load folder, this needs to be copied into our slash pipeline slash not orchestration, but data extract load, [00:16:00] and then we copy similarly, but we copy the transformation.\\n\\nData transformation. Into our data transformation here, like this. Copy this one, and now we'll copy our orchestration into pipeline slash orchestration like this. Or since we are in pipeline orchestration, we could do like dot. Okay. And now run PIP install. We need to have Dexter. We need to have Dexter dash DBT Dexter dash DLT Dexter dash web server.\\n\\nWe need DBT dash core. We need DBT dash db. We need [00:17:00] TLT. We need Tech db. Okay. And now we will do command. We'll run text there. We'll run dev, we'll run dash F and the definitions. File definitions. Do PI\\n\\ndash h and the host is 0, 0 0 0. A local host. And the port is 3000. Okay, I think we've got it. Lemme just open a new terminal. Okay. I will ~~re ~~remove this data warehouse here. ~~This the duct B here, ~~since we have bind mounted. ~~We have done this docker compose here. We have bind mounted this.data, wear ~~this data warehouse folder to this data warehouse.\\n\\nWhatever ends up in the inside of the container inside of [00:18:00] this data warehouse folder in the container it will end up here. In this data warehouse as well. That is the idea. Okay, now let's go into ls. We'll see our docker compose, ? Docker compose app dash D. Okay. It's installing a lot of things.\\n\\nFirst time for this other image. With Docker Compose here, we have two services. We have two. Containers running. We have one that is data warehouse pipeline and one that is our dashboard.\\n\\nYes, it takes a little bit of time. The first time,\\n\\nyeah, I can close this down and wait until it's finished.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-4:** Okay, let's open up the browser to look into our~~ local host 3000. ~~Local host 3000. And you can see it works. However, there's some failure here. ~~Assets ~~we cannot see any assets reload definitions. Just to check out and we get an error [00:19:00] message here. What is the issue? It cannot find the dbt.\\n\\nThis profiles director, it cannot be found. ~~And the, that, ~~the problem is that I forgot to change a few things. We need to set those now. First in our definitions file here, we need to update a few things. We need to update let's see here. ~~We need to have a d ~~This is the DB path, ?\\n\\nWe'll have\\n\\nremove this one and we'll have here duck DB path. Equals to os Get E nv. We need to pick our duck DB path and then we'll need to have our DBT profiles. Directory equals to os. Get NV DBT profiles [00:20:00] dear, because remember here. We send in our DBT profiles directory. We send in our duck DB path environment variables.\\n\\nThen we need to import os. Okay? We get these things in our definitions files. Let's see. Is there something else that I have forgotten?\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-5:** take a look into this. We have DBT profiles DI did. ~~We take a look into DBT profiles. Did you can see ~~Yes, it is here. Good. ~~We have let's see. ~~We need to put in, in our DBT project, actually, DBT project~~ let's see. Project, yeah. ~~DBT, project director here, DBT project. ~~Let's see. ~~It's the DBT project and here we have project directory.\\n\\nAnd here you see we have profiles. Di did. This is not correct anymore. We'll remove this one and instead here we'll have our~~ pro DT, let's see, ~~DBT profiles there. Okay, this is [00:21:00] very important. And also here in the destination, here we have ~~DDB path, ? ~~DDB Path. Now this should work in our docker containers.\\n\\nSoon we'll actually go into our profiles as well. Let's go into our profiles. Open slash dot dbt slash profiles yaml. Here you can see there's a DBT Duck db. ~~This is we will do like this. ~~We'll change this to ~~DBT Duck db. Actually, we can still have it here, it doesn't matter. But I will change it here.~~\\n\\nDBT Duck db Docker Local. And here we'll have Targets Dev, outputs Dev, and we'll have type db. We'll have the path and the path here. Let's pick that from our environment variable. ~~Enver ~~environment variable, and we'll pick Duck DB [00:22:00] under score path. Yeah, we don't need to install formatter for that.\\n\\nYes. This DVTD DB Docker Local, as you can see this is taking the environment variable, that DB path, which we have set and sent ~~in our, when we ~~in our docker file. I'll close this profiles yaml. And now we just need to do like this let me see in transformations. DBT project at yaml.\\n\\nHere, we need to change this one that it points towards the correct one. Docker local. Save this one. Okay. ~~Don't ~~don't mind the red. It's just the editor that has problem. Okay. Let's do Docker. Compose down.\\n\\nDocker Compose app dash D. Okay.\\n\\nAnd now let's go into our browser. Reload this one. [00:23:00] Let's see. Go into our assets, reload definitions. Okay, there is still an error. Let me just close this one down. Go into browser again. Local host 3000. Yeah, there's still an error here. Let me debug and come back.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-6:** Okay, with some debugging, I have managed to find the problem. ~~Here. We have here ~~I forgot this path here, but~~ we add, ~~I add this path that we have the path to DBT Profiles, directory and also remember in DBT project at yaml, we point towards DBT Duck DB Docker local. ~~And ~~and then when you have done the changes, you also need to do docker, compose down to close down everything, close down the containers, and then docker, compose up dash D.\\n\\nBut that is not enough because if the images already [00:24:00] existed ~~and, ~~and even if you change files, it'll just pick the old images, you can't force it to build dash build. When you run this one, it will run for a while and then afterwards it should work. For me, I've already done that.\\n\\nI will just do docker compost app dash D. Now if I do Docker PS, you can see that I have two containers. I have the data pipeline here, and I have this. Dockerized Data pipeline dashboard. Then we can go ~~into browser and ~~into the browser. The local host 3000. And here you can see this is my Dexter.\\n\\nLet's go into the assets. And you can see it has been loaded perfectly. ~~Okay? ~~View, lineage, it works, and we can materialize all. Then when it's materializing, you can see that this one will run here now, and then ~~this ~~this three will subsequently run. ~~Okay. ~~After we do this, you can see in our VS code that we will get back our job ads tech db, our [00:25:00] data will go there.\\n\\nWe'll go into the browser and you can see it's finished materializing, and then we can go into locals 85 0 1 and you can see the streaming dashboard works. ~~Okay, this this is how it worked. ~~We have managed to dockerize our pipeline and dockerize our dashboard.\\n\\nOkay, in this video you've seen me working with Docker to containerize both the data pipeline and ~~to containerize the ~~the dashboard into two different services using Docker Compose. And~~ they were connecting to ~~they were pointing to two different Docker files. That is quite cool.\\n\\nAnd~~ you, ~~you can see that it worked locally. The next step is to use this and push it to Azure. Azure Container Registry, and then connect it ~~towards an ~~to a web app. That will be really cool and I hope that you'll follow along and learn a lot more. Thank you for watching this video and see you in the next one.\\n\\nBye.\\n\\n\",\n",

This will require us to make different roles we'll make a user we'll create. That we give ~~the grants ~~the proper grants and privileges to our roles and user. And then we will take a look into the API ~~we'll in investigate and ~~doing some exploratory data analysis on the API ~~and then afterwards ~~when, we have done that, we will go into loading this API data into Snowflake, and then we'll go into Snowflake through Snow SQL and also in s site to check out the data. This is still extract and load part ~~of ~~of the ELT, ~~EL part. And then ~~afterwards we have ~~date. ~~DBT for transformations. We'll go [00:01:00] into the browser first.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-1:** Here I am in the code repository and we'll work with~~ abit for mailing data. ~~A mailing, API, this is a Swedish data for job ads. And we'll go in there and take a look. This is the page. ~~We'll go in there. ~~However I'll also note here before I jump out is that ~~we have this ~~we need to use ~~this.~~\\n\\nThe DLT the secrets tool to set up the connection to Snowflake. We will go through that as well. Remember to note this down 'cause this we'll use later. And then I will go into this page here. ~~We come to ~~let me close this. Code, examples, start here. ~~We have ~~here we have job search examples, pi.\\n\\nHere you have the code to get started and basically ~~here is that, ~~get ads and then using these examples and then you can query on different jobs. We'll use [00:02:00] this first to explore the data, and then we will turn this into, dLT later on that we can connect it ~~to ~~to load the data into Snowflake.\\n\\nLet's move on to Visual Studio Code now.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-2:** Here I am in visual Studio Code and ~~we ~~let's start off with ~~UV VNV. We have ~~a virtual environment ~~source, ven ~~being activated. ~~Activated, ~~and then ~~UV ~~PIP install. We need to have DLT ~~Snow ~~Snowflake. Okay. And then we need to have IPI kernel for PYN notebook. ~~And I. Think this should be maybe Yeah.~~\\n\\nRequests we need to get the data from the API. Okay, this is done and now we will create~~ actually I need ~~terminal. I will create, make the DLT code where I'll place the DLT code. I will have~~ worksheet ~~worksheets, snowflake. And this is it. I will also do touch gi, ignore, [00:03:00] inside of gi, ignore, I will make sure to remove dlt.\\n\\nBecause we'll have our secrets over there and we will also get rid of~~ let's see. And ~~DLT set up user ~~I will also get rid of. ~~Okay, now it's time to go into CD ~~worksheets ~~worksheet Snowflake. And inside here I will create a few SKL files. I'll create setup setup database sql.\\n\\nSet up ~~users, ~~user s, kl, and then I will have check loaded data sql. ~~Set up and then we'll have ~~set up roles. Sgl. If you have watched the video before, it's a kind of similar setup. ~~You need to set, ~~you need to create the database inside of Snowflake. You need to create the schema. You need to create the roles, you need to [00:04:00] create the user for DLT.\\n\\nAnd then ~~you give ~~you give the grants to the roles for different things. For example, ~~the work, the what's called. We need to give ~~the warehouse, the database and the different select and different ~~crowd ~~operations to different roles. ~~And then we also need to ~~and why I do Git ~~nor ~~in setup user is because I want to place ~~in ~~my password there and we shouldn't push the password up to GitHub if you're working in GitHub repository.\\n\\nThis is not a GitHub repository, but I put it in gi Ignore here to make sure that when you're watching this and following along, you don't push up your secrets there. And also same with ~~dot ~~DLT, because there we'll have our secrets ~~do two. Now I will see the up. ~~Now I am back into ~~route ~~and I will do C-D-D-L-T code and inside of DLT code, let's touch a few things.\\n\\nTouch I want to have a ~~P Ed, IB. ~~This is the Jupyter Notebook that we will use for exploring the API. [00:05:00] We'll have load job ads do pi that ~~this ~~is the pipeline. You can see here that they exist now, and we will also do. ~~Make Dear ~~DLT and in not DTL r ~~dash rf dtl. Let's see make dear dot ~~d lt and then we'll do touch DLT slash secrets ~~two.~~\\n\\nOkay. Let's start here. Let's go back to our browser and. Let's get back here and I will go into this copy, this part here. This is the DLTs connection to Snowflake. Paste it in here. I will call this job ads, this database. And the username is extract loader. You need to create this user if you haven't done that.\\n\\nBut I'll show you how to do that. And then this password, I will pause my video and I will set this up. And also ~~the host ~~the host you find ~~in in ~~in your account [00:06:00] details. Inside of Snow site, you click on your account and you click on account details. You will find your account identifier.\\n\\nThat is what you need. The account identifier you. Paste it in is basically a few capital letters and then dash a few capital letters. Okay. And then the warehouse, which is Dev warehouse, this is the one I created. But if you don't have that, you should either create that or you can choose another warehouse that you have.\\n\\nAnd the role that we have is job ads, DLT role. This role doesn't exist yet either. This will create in our setup roles and the database will create, that's called job ads ~~There. ~~And also the user will create this extract loader. Now I'll post the video and I will set my own password and my own host.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-3:** We'll start with setting up the user, and then for that I'll use the user role user admin. [00:07:00] Note that I am logged into my SNO sq l account here in the Snowflake extension. I'll run this one. I'm using user admin, and then it's great. Actually I can copy this one from the lecture notes.\\n\\nHere, create user, if not exists, extract loader. Note that this one I place in the setup user and this setup user is get ignored. And then I will pause my video to to set up the my password and I will use the same password as I have in. Secrets two. This is very important. Otherwise, it won't work when you're loading the data later on in DLT.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-5:** Remember to run the create user after you have put in your password. I have already done that. That is finished. Now it's time to set up the database. And to do that, I will use the role. Let's see, use the role si admin run this one. And then I will do create database, if [00:08:00] not exists.\\n\\nJob ads. I'll create this database. And then I will do create schema, if not exists. Job ads do staging. Okay, now we have created that one and it's time to~~ do ~~set up the roles. I'll go into, set up the roles and change language to snow, like SQL. Now we'll create this role. A use role user admin.\\n\\nI'll run this one. Create role, if not exists. And what do I want to create? I want to create job ads DLT role. I create this role and then it's time to you, you, I'll change the role to security admin. This is the one that will handle the grant, right? Grant the role. Grant [00:09:00] role job adds, DLT roll to user extract loader.\\n\\nAnd also I'll grant this to myself. Job adds DLT role to user tion. Okay. I grant it to myself. And now it's time for us to grant and I won't I'll just copy this one as I have done this all before. I copy all this and I will explain it to you. First, we grant usage on warehouse, dev warehouse to roll job as DLT.\\n\\nIt needs to have the warehouse in order to do the compute, right? Grant, and then we need to grant usage on database job ads that it can access this, view, this database. And then we need to grant usage on the staging schema. And then we grant create table on schema staging. In inside of staging it can create tables which is needed [00:10:00] for DLT.\\n\\nAnd then afterwards I will do. I will do crowd operations it can it, I will give it all of them. Select, insert, update, delete on all tables in the schema, and then Grant, select insert update, delete on future tables in schema. In in tables that we'll create later on, it will.\\n\\nStill get it, it will still be able to do this within the staging schema, not in other schemas. We don't want to give it more privileges than it should have. Okay. And with this I want to run all of them. Click on this one. This will execute ~~from ~~from beginning to end. Okay. And now it's time to ~~show ~~check our grants.\\n\\nI will copy that as well. Show grants on schema, job ads. The staging, you can see create table usage and ownership on the schema. On [00:11:00] the schema you have these things and then. ~~Future grants. ~~In schema, you can see we have the lead insert, select, and update. The crowd operations on all the tables within this schema is give this schema.\\n\\nStaging is given to this granted to this job as DLT role, and then show grants to this role. And what you can see is that it has usage, create table usage on these different database schemas and warehouses .\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-6:** And then let's do show grants to User Extract Loader. And you can see that the Extract Loader has gotten this job ads DLT role and also you can do show grants to the user that you used yourself. I used Tion as the, it's my user. You can check that. You also have this role that you can ~~see the ~~see and work with the.\\n\\nTables that DLT will create for us later on. [00:12:00] Okay, this is setting up the role ~~and ~~and now basically we have set up a database. We have set up the roles, we have set up the user. And what we need to do now is to explore the data basically. In order to explore the data we have here I would call this, eDA on job tech API, because ~~what? ~~This is what it's called. And basically what we'll do first is that we'll go into the browser and inside here this is the code that we'll have. I'll copy this code basically. I will copy this code. I'll go back here, paste it in, change this to Python. Let's see, Python environments.\\n\\nDLT. Extract. Load, yes. Okay, I will remove that one and just run this and see what we get. And then I'll go through it a little [00:13:00] bit. Okay. Run it. And we can see that we get a lot of teachers here. This is in Swedish, ladder it is S blah blah, blah, because we have queried, ladder sala. What it does is that we do.\\n\\nExample, search loop through hits. Query it goes to here, into this one. And here we have search parents, the query, and then we have the limit, ~~how many ~~how many how much limit we want. And then the JSON response is basically this underscore get ads function. You can take a look into this, get ads.\\n\\nWhat it does is that we have. The response here is the request get, and you have to send in this headers to get the back, the chason, and you put in the URL for search and the different paras that you have. This is the paras that you send in and you send in the search paras. And then you do response that this is to check for errors, and then you have JSON loads.\\n\\nBasically you get this back [00:14:00] into JSON data. This is basically how you get the data from this API and the URL for search. You can see it up here is this URL here. It's basically this URL and then slash such. Okay. And with this one you can also do this example such loop through hits, and it will go through the hits and you will get to print out the headlines.\\n\\nHit employer and name. Now we have 11 hits, but let's move on a little bit. We can test out a few functions. Example. Search return number of hits we can do. Setting our query. And what you can see, we get number hits is 11. What else can we do? We can go into, we can take a look into the search risk.\\n\\nWe can go and copy these ones [00:15:00] here.\\n\\nThis is the search pars and this is the JSON response. And you can take a look into the JS response basically. And this JSON response, you can see that it's a dictionary, you can take a look into that. One type is a dick, and if it's a dick, you have the keys, right? Keys. And then the keys, you can see there's total positions query time, result time stats, free text con concepts, and hits.\\n\\nOkay, then we can take a look into different things. We could do Jason response dot get. Hits. And then you see we get this is similar. You get a list of the number of hits. This is a list. You can do take a list. You can not take a list but length of this one. And you can see it's 11.\\n\\nIt's same as the one that we had [00:16:00] before where we have the number of hits here. Okay. What else can we do? We can do. We copied this one. This gets all the hits and we can take a look into one hit. The first one or the second one, if it's counting with starting with zero. You can see here we have one, one school here.\\n\\n~~Y~~\\n\\n~~This apply want teacher. And ~~what we can do here is since this is a dictionary, you can see that with this one calibrates and you can see key and value pairs. Then what you can do is dot keys to check out what's inside here. Yes, there's a lot of different things. Inside of hits, we have keys, right?\\n\\nAnd then we can take a look a little bit further going in here. We can take a look into the headline. For example, headline, and we can see Jensen Naum. Okay. And we can [00:17:00] continue here. ~~We can ~~we can take a look into we go up here and copy this part here.\\n\\nTo get the, to search for something else and then you can see the query. Let's change the query a little bit. In, we can type it out here directly. I'll search for data engineer 'cause this is our field. And for data engineer, we can do get ads on that one. And also you can see, we can place this directly into this one here, we don't need to divide it if we don't want to.\\n\\nAnd then we can take a look at the JSON response. Okay. A lot of jobs. 78 I guess. And 99 positions. Okay, great. Let's see. Dot keys. And it's same as before. What you can do now is that for example, we can take a look into Jason response of hits and ~~we, ~~it's a list we can take out [00:18:00] minus one to get the last one, and we can take out the headline.\\n\\nAnd we can see, okay. Senior software engineer data and video analytics learned. Okay, great. And we can take a look into, I'll copy this one and take a look into their employer because that was one that we saw before. That, that is one of the keys. ~~And ~~and inside of the employer, we see here phone number.\\n\\nWe see email, URL organization number name is this Axis communications. And what we can do is that we can pick out the names if we want, we pick out the name. Okay, great. Now you can see that okay. It's a senior software engineer for this company. Okay, this concludes the EDA that we need ~~and late ~~and now we will go into the actual DLT code where we'll use this that we [00:19:00] have learned from the EDA to actually load the data from this API into snowflake \\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-7:** let's move on to low job ads. The DLT. We go in here and we import DLT. We import requests. We need the requests, right? We import JSON and we take from lib import path and then import os. These are just a few imports that we need. And then now we will go back to API key, our A-P-E-D-A.\\n\\nAnd here ~~we have ~~we have these get ads. This is what I want. I will copy this one. Actually, I'll copy all these, actually, yeah, I'll copy this. Go back in here, paste it here. First we have this get ads. And here I [00:20:00] will put in URL for search. That you can get different ads depending on what you want to search for.\\n\\nOkay. And then ~~we will do, ~~we will create our resource, at DLT resource. This is a way of grouping several data yielding. Data where we get data from. Different resources are the lowest unit, and they can be combined into a. DLT source. Which we will take from the source or the resource to the target.\\n\\nAnd the target is the destination, which is snowflake in this case. We take DLT resource and we can choose the right disposition here, and I'll choose replace as the simplest one. But there's also append and merge for doing ~~diff ~~other types of rights. Depending on what you need, you [00:21:00] might be able to be interested in using the other ones.\\n\\nDeaf job ads, resource. And here we'll take in paras and we'll take these two, I'll move them down in here, I move them with alt down button, or option down button if you're in the Mac. Here we have URL and URL for search. And now I will take four add in, underscore get, add. We take this function, we put in URL for such, and put in the paras the different parameters that we have.\\n\\nThe parents will be sent into here and the pars will be sent into this function. Get ads, and we'll use the pars here. On for our GET request. Okay? After we do [00:22:00] that, we remember that when we get the ads, we need to go into hits in order to get our jobs right. I will take dot, get hits.\\n\\nIt's a dictionary. We do not get hits. We get the hits and then we yield the ad. Remember that when we go into hits, we get a list and then we yield the ads. We send out one, we send one, we return one ad at the time. One item at the time. That is what yield does. It's yield instead of return, which will return everything.\\n\\nThis is a generator. I won't go in exactly what that means, but this is what you have here. You're yielding each ad when you're calling this. And this is required by our pipeline later on. Let's create our pipeline. I will change it a little bit. Now. I will put it, put the pipeline before in, in [00:23:00] another video before we put it into our script directly in if done the name equals standard domain, but now I will create a function of it.\\n\\nI'll call it run pipeline. Send in a query and table name that you can customize it a little bit. And then pipeline equals to DLT pipeline. And here we have pipeline name equals to ~~job search.~~\\n\\n~~And we have let's see. We have pipeline name equals ~~job search and we have destination equals to snowflake. Remember that this destination, it will look into our secrets to two and inside there we had specified snowflake. Destination and the configuration for that. Okay, after this part, ~~we want to go into let's see.~~\\n\\n~~We have, we should have three. ~~We should have dataset name also, which is the schema. Staging schema or staging layer. This is where our data will land. [00:24:00] And then after we have this~~ we will run, ~~we will you take the pars equals to it. Remember that the pars is defined like this. We have q for our query.\\n\\nWhat, whatever we type in here for query. For example, we want to search for data engineer and then we put in data engineer here in this query and we have a limit here. I'll make it default to 100. And I won't go through how to do pagination here, but basically you can do pagination and work with limit Together with offset in order to get more data.\\n\\nI have that in the repo, if you are interested in you can take a look into that, but I won't go through it here how that works. I also have another video where I do, basically the same thing where I have the the pagination implemented. However, instead of snowflake, we used the, we used ddb.\\n\\n[00:25:00] You can take a look into that video. I will link that in the description. Take a look into that if you are interested in how to do pagination. Okay. But I want do it here. We have the paras. We'll do load info equals to pipeline. Not run. We run the pipeline. And we put in, when we run the pipeline, we need to put in the resource or we need to put in the source.\\n\\nWe put in job ads, resources. You can see data is the first one. Job ads, resource, this is our data we place in pars equals to pars. Look at this job ads resource. It requires this paras. We're sending these paras with query and limit, it gets these paras and then it will send this into this, get ads, and we will return back the hits based on the query, basically like that.\\n\\nOkay? [00:26:00] It means that we had this loan info. Which runs the pipeline and then we print this load info and that is it. And now we can do if done, the name equals to done domain, and I will do, I need to do working directory equals to path then the file.\\n\\nParent. Working directory, this is the Dunder Path parent. We're into this file, parent, we go into DLT code, but here. This working director, you'll be able to see dlt. That is because when we click on the run button, it it runs based on where you are in the terminal. If you are in this route up here, then you won't find your secrets or you won't find your [00:27:00] dlt.\\n\\nThat's why we have to create this working director and then we need to do this OS change deal. ~~Working directory. Okay. ~~And now I will ~~change, ~~do my query. I'll call data engineer and table name. I will call this data field job ads. This is the table name that I will send into my run pipeline. I send in query is data engineer, let's say query.\\n\\nQuery comma table name, and then we need to use the table name here. And what we do is inside our pipeline we can do table name. Equals to table name and basically is that we, okay, we have dataset name. This is the schema, the staging. And inside this, we'll create this table with this table name here, that this data field job ads.\\n\\nWe'll get this table basically, [00:28:00] save this one and I'll run this one,\\n\\nand then it takes a little bit of time.\\n\\nOkay, after it has run, we have pipeline job, search load, step completed one load packages where loaded destination, snowflake, and in dataset staging [00:29:00] job as location load package. Okay, we can take a look into our. Loaded data now. We'll go into our check loaded data and I'll change the language to Snow Snowflake SL and we will use the ~~roll.~~\\n\\nLet's see, use role. Job adds, DLT role and run this one. And then we'll have use database\\n\\njob ads. Run this one and I will show schemas. You can see which schemas we have. Yes, we have information schema, public and staging. Okay, we can show [00:30:00] tables in schema staging. Then we have a lot of tables here, and you can see we have. Okay. We have a lot of tables to see data, field job ads must have education level, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd we have here data field job ads. There's a lot of data that has been loaded, oh, sorry. ~~It's, ~~what you can do is that you can select on all the ~~diff ~~different ones to see what data has been loaded there by DLT and see which data that is relevant for you, which you can work on later on. This is one reason why we placing everything, we dumped the data into staging and then.\\n\\nIn the staging layer, you pick out the data that you want and you go into the next layer, which is the refined layer and where you can do your [00:31:00] transformations. Here I want to just take a look into this staging.data field. Job ads, it's called. I will describe table, take a look into this one, and you can see, oh this is the ones that we get from the hits.\\n\\nWe get relevance Id label, webpage, UL, headline, et cetera. Description, text. There's a lot of a lot of different columns here. Then we can use. Let's see. We can do select headline employer let's see what we can pick. Employer here. Let's see. Employ, let me see.\\n\\nEmployment type here. Were employment type. Yeah. There it's not [00:32:00] alphabetically, but yeah, we can. Just employer workplace. Maybe there should be one if they haven't changed it from staging.data. Field job ads. Run this one. Yes, it works. Here we have a employer workplace. What you can do more is basically, for example description, text.\\n\\n~~We could take. ~~Yes. And you can see here is the description formulate h and m job description. Okay. Data engineer, air tele two. Yeah, it's a little bit longer description. Good. We can do yeah, basically here ~~you can ~~you can do a lot of things. ~~You want to select the. ~~We can perhaps pick out one one employer, for example.\\n\\nOkay. A TG. Do we have more things there? ~~Select ~~select star from staging, do [00:33:00] data field job ads~~ group by or where we can take, ~~where employer. Workplace equals a TG, maybe? Yes. And then we only had one, right? Yeah. One data engineer. Okay. now you can work with this as you want. I will save this one and I will show you that the data actually have been loaded into Snowflake.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-8:** Inside of Snowflake or Snow site, we can see that we have this data field job ads under. This is the job ads database. And here we have the staging and we have a lot of tables. ~~We have this data field job ads, and ~~you can see the data preview here. It'll take a little bit time for it to load.\\n\\nI can see this because I've assigned the role ~~to ~~to myself. ~~I can see that. ~~And here you can ~~see ~~see the different [00:34:00] things that we loaded. You can see here the one that we got before data engineer at reflex, this description, text, et cetera. ~~Okay. And ~~and you can see there's a lot of columns here.\\n\\n66 columns. You can take a look into that one. And what DLT does is that you can see how ~~the ~~it has nest. Basically you have nested data, right? ~~You have a lot of ~~you have a json object with a lot of nested. ~~And and the nested ones become two underscores and. ~~And in DLT it's possible to load based on the level that you want.\\n\\nBut when it goes even deeper level, you can see if you drag it out here, that it's continuing another nest. Here, data field, job ads, and then underscore, underscore application contacts. Actually, this one could be very ~~u ~~useful for you if you want to. You could join the tables later on.\\n\\nHere you can get the different emails for different people that if you want to apply for these jobs, you can take their emails and their phone numbers~~ and ~~and you can use it. And also here [00:35:00] you have for example, here's another one that is quite nested. You have here education.\\n\\nAnd you can see the data preview ~~and, ~~but there's not much data there, this is also something you could take a look at and go through each of them. ~~Okay,~~\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-9:** in this video we have used DLT to load the data from the job tech API, and we have extracted and loaded it from the API into snowflake. And then we ~~go want, ~~went into working with snow SK l to actually ~~test, ~~test it out and saw that, yeah, we got data we could ~~do, ~~query on the data, and then we went into snow site and checked that the data was there.\\n\\nBut before this, ~~we were ~~we needed to set up the database, the roles in we use snows well, but you could ~~do, use it, ~~do it ~~in ~~in worksheets, in Snowflake in snow site. That will also work. But yes, we have gone through the el part of the ELT. This is the start of your. Pipeline where you ingested data from an [00:36:00] API.\\n\\nThis is super cool. Thank you for watching this video and hope that you have started to get interest in Modern Data Stack and continue to learn more. See you in the next video. Bye.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'content': \"# SQL analytics with DuckDB - introduction\\n\\n[00:00:00] Hello and welcome to this lecture in SQL introduction and we'll go into the theory about the introduction to SQL and using ~~D ~~DB in SQL. This is an introductory lecture in this course SQL analytics with ~~D ~~db. You will learn a lot about how. To use ~~D ~~DB to turn metadata into valuable insights.\\n\\nThat is the main topic for this course. And later on in this course, we'll also connect to Python that you can work with DB within the Python ecosystem and within the data science, data engineering, data analytics ecosystem. This is really fun and we'll go directly to the slides to get an introduction to what, sQL is.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-2:** Turning data into valuable insights using SQL. We start with an example, an ice cream startup. [00:01:00] Swedish glass is using Excel sheets to store data. This might be ~~a sound like ~~a viable solution ~~in the beginning, and it is ~~in the beginning. You just store the data in Excel sheets. We have orders, we store them in Excel sheets.\\n\\nWe have customers, we store them in Excel sheets, we have inventory. We store them in Excel sheets. Okay. It sounds quite simple and yeah, we can start like this. It's no problems ~~in the beginning. Okay. ~~In the beginning. But the company grew. This was really a classic, like people really like this ice cream.\\n\\nThey ordered a lot. And we got a lot of customers. And then when we did that, we needed to employ more people. The thing is, we have a team now, each Excel file is shared across the team. We have orders, we have customers, we have inventory. ~~And also a lot more, of course, ~~when the business is growing.\\n\\nBut let's simplify to this. We have [00:02:00] one person that is working with this. We have another one that is working with this. We have a third one that is working with this and a fourth one. ~~Okay. ~~If there's a lot of people working with these Excel sheets and we get a lot of data, then it's quite easy to get duplicates, for example.\\n\\nCommon problems that ~~are ~~arose when sharing Excel sheets in this way, we get data duplication. Accidentally ~~we create ~~creating duplicates without knowing ~~about ~~that these lines may have existed elsewhere. ~~That is ~~and that is the problem that we need to manually update in several places.\\n\\nAnd we get inconsistent data. For example, we look for one person and then suddenly there is a similar person with different addresses or same person with different addresses. Then we have an inconsistency in addresses, for example. One is [00:03:00] a typo. Another one is not we have relationships.\\n\\nIt's hard to manage manually between customers and orders, which customer connects to which orders that is hard to manage manually. Team, they manually links the order to the right customer. This takes a lot of time and it's manual effort, and it will lead to inconsistencies and bugs like you, you do errors because humans it's human is not good at manual work performance.\\n\\nOur Excel sheet is growing larger and larger, and this will cause performance issues. It'll get slow ~~to ~~to work with huge amounts of data in Excel and many more problems that we won't go into in this slide here. The idea is that we need something else ~~to ~~to manage this when our company's [00:04:00] growing.\\n\\nAn example of inconsistent data. You can see it here due to manual input. For example, here you have Alice Frost, alice@example.com and this address, and then you have Alice f alice\\\\_f@example.com. Okay? It seems to be the same person or same phone number, same address. But here we have LSF, here we have Alice Frost.\\n\\nHere are Alice F at example. Here we have Alice at example. Is it the same person or not? That is a question. Is this the same person? This is and also we will come back more into how to handle inconsistent data and how to. Make sure that the data is unique and what is determining a unique row, et cetera.\\n\\nThis will come back more into a data modeling course later on. However, for ~~this in ~~this course, we'll focus a lot in sk l queries and how to analyze the data. ~~And ~~this is due [00:05:00] to being able to both learn. Fundamentals in SQL and to work with it with analytics and for transactional later on.\\n\\nAnd also we will learn it ~~for ~~that you can go~~ on ~~for example, ~~go ~~towards data warehouses and you do need to understand how to analyze the data. But that was a side note on what I just said. Now, which ~~Alice ~~is linked to what orders in the orders table. Using relational databases and SQL, we can handle many of these issues.\\n\\nSQL is a structured query language ~~and we work, ~~and the database is a relational database, there are also non relational databases such as a document database, vector database, et cetera. And no SQL. But here we have relational databases and SQL, they follow something called the relational model that will come back later on as [00:06:00] well.\\n\\nDefine relationships in SQL tables. ~~If ~~this ensures data consistency. ~~Op, ~~they're optimized for large volumes of data, scalable and efficient for querying of data. Data constraints, like data types and unique values ~~are ~~are put in ~~that they ~~make sure that the data conforms to a specific type.\\n\\nFor example, you have a numeric column, then you cannot put in strings or ~~other ~~other types of data. ~~And ~~and you have unique values. You can make unique constraints. This makes sure that we get automatic validation, which reduces error. I talk about this type of thing.\\n\\nThis part is more concern with something called OLTP that will come back to more transactional databases. And there's a lot of ~~more more ~~nice benefits ~~with ~~with a database. SKL, what is this? [00:07:00] What is SGL is structured query language. We have create, update, and we organize data into tables.\\n\\nOkay? Tables, we have rows and columns. You can see it is similar to the Excel sheets. You have rows and columns, right? And SGL has standardized language. It's standardized. There, there is a lot of different flavors of SQL, but mostly it's similar. And ~~there, ~~there's some syntax that differs.\\n\\nBut the foundation is the same. It's based on a relational model. And what this means is that we organize data into related tables. We link the data through unique identifiers. ~~What ~~if you don't understand what this means right now, it's fine. And we'll come back to this ~~term ~~terminology later on.\\n\\nThere's some core functions within SQL. [00:08:00] We get DDL data definition language.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-3:** define structure of database, for example tables and what type of data it holds. We use the crate alter and drop, for example. We can create table, we can alter the table, we can drop tables. This is DDL, data, definition language. Moving on, ~~we have let's see. Oh, sorry. ~~We have data manipulation language, DML, these are to manipulate data directly in the database.\\n\\nwe have insert command, we have update command, we have delete command,\\n\\nand then we have DQL data query language. It's to select to you, you use select statement to retrieve a specific information from a database. Letting users access and fill the data for insights. We use the select statement and or the select class.\\n\\nWe'll see. We will use it very a [00:09:00] lot in this course to analyze the data and we use it together with a lot of other things to filter. For example, the wear class, the group buy, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd then we have DCL data control language. We have here you can revoke and grant to give access to other uses.\\n\\nYou, you may want to give access to certain uses for certain type, certain database or certain tables, right? Depending on which SQL you use there's a possibility for more or less. DCL. Yes. And then we go into the SQL flavor that we will use in this course we'll use Duck db.\\n\\nMeet Duck db a modern, powerful database management system for analytics. It's super powerful, it's super performant. ~~And also it's something called oap. Opt, ~~it's optimized for intensive analytical [00:10:00] queries that you can do locally in your own computer. And it's very easy to set up. ~~It's it's just a, ~~you just use a ~~file, a duct ~~DB file, and then you can connect to it in the terminal.\\n\\nAnd also we talked about Ola. Then we need to mention OLTP, which is for transactional database. That is optimized for a lot of inserts into the database. For example, other ~~SGL other ~~RD. Such as Postgres, ~~SGL, ~~Microsoft ~~sgl ~~they use and they are ~~OLCP, ~~right?\\n\\nWhile ~~Dtb, RO ~~is Ola. It's very highly performant, on your own machine and can handle large data sets. It's embedded database, no need for separate server and database is contained in the file. This makes it very simple to work with and very good to start with as a as a first course within ~~SKL ~~analytics.\\n\\nTo just learn how to get insights from the data, [00:11:00] to filter the data, to manipulate it in the way that you want. And it integrates very well with other tools in the data science ecosystem or data engineering, data analytics ecosystem such as Python. Pandas and data frames. We will work with it together with pandas in this course that you can see the power of combining Python and ~~a scale combining Python and Duct ~~DB in order ~~to ~~to get data insights that you want.\\n\\nVery good for data analysis, can run complex queries for analytics and reporting. And it's very good for building data transformations in an ETL pipeline to serve business intelligence and ai. We'll come back ~~in ~~in more if you follow me, ~~we have a lot of, ~~I have courses in ~~data within ~~data engineering, a lot of them.\\n\\nAnd then there I usually build ~~pipelines ~~ETL or ELT pipelines to be more. Specific. ~~And ~~and there DDB is a core part. Could be a core [00:12:00] part of it where you store the data. You could use DDB as the data warehouse, for example. A data engineering pipeline with an OLA database as a data warehouse.\\n\\nThe reason why I picked data engineering pipeline is that when you're working with data analytics, you usually~~ you ~~have the data. You want the data to go through different types of transformations. Here's~~ engineering pipe, ~~data, engineering pipeline, and we use for example, DDB as the data warehouse.\\n\\nBut you could use something else, ~~a cloud, ~~such as snowflake, ~~for example for that but or ~~Amazon, Redshift ~~or some, ~~or Google BigQuery. But~~ but TDB ~~could work for local solution. What you have is that you have different data sources. ~~This ~~this could be like CSV files ~~here. It could have like ~~APIs.\\n\\nYou could have other types of data. And they are ingested into a data warehouse. The data warehouse could be this DDB file, for example. And then you serve dashboard. You [00:13:00] serve machine learning models. Then you need to transform the data ~~into certain way, ~~certain formats ~~that ~~they can be served ~~to this downstream ~~downstream.\\n\\nApplications. Here you have ELT. Extract and load. You extract and load the data into your data warehouse. Then you transform it inside your data warehouse, and then you serve the data for the end users. And the dashboards and the ML models. Here, for example, other people can take over.\\n\\nFor example, the BI analyst could take over here could be like a machine learning engineer or a data scientist that take over and~~ and and take ~~take the data from the data warehouse. Ddb, it could work as a lightweight data warehouse for small to medium sized. Data. ~~And if you ~~and if you grow out of your DDB database that it means that you cannot do it locally anymore, then you can consider ~~cloud ~~cloud solutions.\\n\\nBut they ~~cost the ~~cost money. Okay? Yes.\\n\\nthat was an [00:14:00] introduction to ~~sq, ~~SQL and DDB ~~in ~~and kind of introduction to this course as well. But we'll have more introductions such as the core structure that you can see what is the actual content of this course. And, who this is suitable for. ~~And here but ~~I hope that you have learned some basic concepts about the motivation, about ~~the ~~why to use SQL and ~~the ~~databases and then also going into ~~like ~~DDB and some motivation about that.\\n\\nStay attuned for more videos where we'll actually go into coding and more practical development and analyzing of data. And that will be really fun. I hope to see you there and thanks ~~to what ~~for watching this video and see you in the next one ~~by, I.~~\\n\\n\",\n",

       "\"# Modern data stack - dockerize your data pipeline\\n\\n[00:00:00] Hello and welcome to this video, which is a continuation on the previous video where we created a modern data stack project using Dexter and D to orchestrate DLT and DBT, and. Storing the data into dtb. Basically it's doing ELT inside and the data is stored in dtb. And then afterwards what you can do is to connect a Streamlet application, of course, and that I have shown in previous videos as well.\\n\\nHere I will just, put in the STREAMLET code that you can see a front end of this. And then afterwards we will go to the main point of this video, which is to dockerize it. We'll containerize the whole data pipeline. And that is really cool because when you have containerized it, ~~it's in ~~it will work in every system.\\n\\nYou don't need to be dependent on. Particular parts of installations, et cetera. The idea is that when this works locally in my [00:01:00] computer very well, then I can easily just deploy it up into Azure and then Azure or a VS or Google Cloud platform or somewhere else. It's it should work as well.\\n\\nAnd and that is really cool. What we'll do here and focus on in this video is to dockerize this.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-1:** I've copied over the folders that I had in the previous lecture. It means that we have our data extract load for DLT. We have data transformation where we have DBT and we have data warehouse, which is this job ads Duck db. And then we have orchestration, which is the Dexter. What we need to do now is a new terminal.\\n\\nAnd I will activate my virtual environment. ~~It's, I already activated. ~~I see. We'll go into orchestration and here I will run Dexter dev dash F definitions [00:02:00] and we can see that this is running our texter web server. Yes. I can click on this Dexter web server and you can see it running here. This is my Dexter web server, and you can see the assets here.\\n\\nYou can see the lineage. This is basically the lineage, okay? And the idea is that now I'm running this in local host, as you can see, local host 3000. ~~But I will close this down. ~~I will close this down. With Ctrl C, the idea is that we want to dockerize this. I want to dockerize this together with Dockerizing the Streamlet app.\\n\\nFor doing that, I will start with pasting in my Streamlet application. Then we will create a. Dashboard here. Another folder, dashboard, and the streamlet application is very simple. I'll just copy these files in here. [00:03:00] From my lecture notes and you can see here, connect Data Warehouse.\\n\\nBasically what it does is that it goes into our DB path OS dot get, NV duck DB path. That means we will go in and create a dot e NV here and we will see what it's called, duck DB path. And this is basically the path to my duck db.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-2:** I choose to write this path here, data warehouse slash job ads db, just to see that we can run it locally. ~~Because why do I do this? ~~Because in this connection now I've also added this from DV import Low DNV and low d nv. That is because we will go here and take the O os, get the NV that we get this ENV path.\\n\\nThis duct D Buff. Here we'll take from do NV now, but later on we'll send this into a dock. We'll dockerize this. We will send in [00:04:00] environment variable and we will change the path as well. We can see that I'm you not using PFL here, I can remove that one. And here you can see this is basically just a convenience function that we can connect to DDB and then do the query basically.\\n\\nAnd then we have a dashboard here. And the dashboard is basically a Stream IT app that is very simple. We have simple layout, and then we run the layout basically like that. And in order to run this, we actually need to be in in the root folder because how I specified this path. I specified it as data warehouse, job ads, tech db, to run this one stream, lead, run dashboard.\\n\\nDashboard pi. Now I have run this one and you can see it works. That, that the reason why we choose I choose this path is because and why I choose to run it [00:05:00] from outside is that when I run it from the root here~~ it will go in will, ~~it will have the path to dockerize data pipeline.\\n\\nAnd then slash and then it adds this path here. We go into data warehouse, we go into job ads, ddb, and this is then the absolute path that is used here for this query for this DDB dot Connect, that we can connect to this data warehouse, this TB file. Okay, that is basically how we run it locally.\\n\\nNow we will try to dockerize this and to dockerize this. We start with creating a few docker files. I will have this in the root. I'll call this docker file.data warehouse because here I will~~ use I will ~~dockerized the data warehouse. Or dockerize basically the [00:06:00] pipeline to create this dashboard.\\n\\nOr the pipeline to ingest the data to transform the data. Basically it's the the one that will create this DDB database. And then we will create one ~~for ~~for the Streamlet application. ~~We'll have one other one. ~~We'll have docker file dot dashboard. This is for the stream list application.\\n\\nAnd here from Python three point 11 slim in. And then ENV. We choose which environment variable. We choose the D DB path. Equals to slash data warehouse slash job ads Duck bb. This is what we send in. Now you can see that okay. This is in [00:07:00] the root of our Docker container.\\n\\nWe have this data warehouse folder, and inside that we have this job, ads Tech db. And then we'll have work directory is in slash app slash dashboard. This is our work directory and we'll just copy our dashboard folder. This one will copy this folder dashboard into our into our slash app.\\n\\nSlash dashboard. We just copy it in. And then we also need to run pip install Streamlet duck db, and Pandas ~~to ~~to run ~~this this ~~this streamlet application. Let's see. Do I need, yeah, I need Titan dash NV as well. In case we use the dot d nv and then command when I spin up this container, I wanted to run this [00:08:00] stream, it run dashboard dot pi\\n\\nserver port equals 85 0 1.\\n\\nDash server address is the local host, 0.0 0.0 0.0\\n\\nbasically like this. And then ~~we will have our ~~we will have our dashboard. ~~It, we, ~~we will orchestrate this with Docker compose that we'll have both this Docker file dashboard and this docker file data warehouse that they will be run. And then ~~we, ~~for, to do that, we'll create a docker dash compost yamo.\\n\\nAnd here we'll have version let's see, 3.9. Actually, I don't think this is needed. Services data warehouse, [00:09:00] pipeline build and context. Okay. The context is dot. And then Docker file will choose the docker file we want. Docker file dot actually I can remove this fast. We'll start with just to show you that it works.\\n\\n~~We'll go into, ~~it's inside of services. I'll go into dashboard first and build.\\n\\nBuild context dots. It means that we'll go into this let me just remove~~ data where, ~~remove this one. ~~Okay. ~~Context that we'll look into this folder here which the dot means. And then docker file will choose docker file dot dashboard. We'll choose here dockerfile dot dashboard, this one, and inside here we'll have volumes.\\n\\nWe'll have [00:10:00] volumes. Is this dot slash data. Warehouse colon slash data warehouse ro.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-3:** Okay, RO means read only. Here we have our dashboard. Let me see. We have this data warehouse, we send it, we take this data warehouse folder, we send it into this slash data warehouse ~~in ~~in our container. Here we can go into ports. We need to do ports mapping. And we will do 8 5 0 1 2 8 5 0 1.\\n\\nYou can see the local host is 8 5 0 1. Like this. Now we have our dashboard ready, then we just do docker, compose up dash d.\\n\\nAnd we'll see if this one works, because now this one [00:11:00] will run the docker file dashboard and inside there we will run the Streamlet apps. We'll see if this one works. It does a lot of installation now, run people install. You can see first time it takes a little bit of time, yeah, I will close this and yeah, it's finished. Okay, great. Now we should be able to go into local host 8 5 0 1 and run this one. And let me just check. Docker, PS And you can see ~~this one. ~~This one this event chair is running. It's up and you can see this port here. We should be able to just copy this one here and go into our browser and paste it in.\\n\\nAnd you can see this dashboard is up now, and you can see here it's the local host 8 5 0 1. And this is the one that is in our Docker container. Cool. It [00:12:00] works. Okay. I'll just. Do Docker compose down to close this one down. Good. And now it's time for my other service. I'll create my data warehouse service.\\n\\nBut that one is dependent on the stock file data warehouse, I can write it first here. Okay, DDWH pipeline. And here we'll have build and same here. Context is dots and then Docker file. It's the doca file data warehouse. And here we'll have volumes. Let's see, volumes. We'll do a read only bind mount here, and note that this you can do for local development.\\n\\nFor local development we go into our home, we take our DBT slash profiles, [00:13:00] yaman. And then we send this into our pipeline. Pipeline slash profiles, yamo and read only. Okay, let me just yeah, the prettier doesn't work very well here, actually. I hope that this one works. Let's see.\\n\\nVolumes. Maybe I have Misti, something I'm not sure. Volumes we will have another volume here dot slash data warehouse. We send this one into our data warehouse. This we create this data warehouse first this job as Duck db using our using this, and using our what is called Dexter, and then we send this folder into here.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLet's see. But then ports [00:14:00] the ports ~~for ~~for Dexter is 3000. We have 3000 mapping towards 3000. Okay. Let's see if this one will work. The prettier doesn't work here. It doesn't yeah, it doesn't help me to okay. May, maybe I need to do this manually. Okay, better. Let's see, dashboard.\\n\\nActually, this ones need to go in here like this. These are part of the dashboard. Actually the dashboard, we don't need the volumes because we already have it. I think. No, actually not we need to put it in. Yes. Here we have the data warehouse pipeline. I just take like this. We have data warehouse pipeline, we have the dashboard, and this maps 3000 to 3000.\\n\\nWhat remains is the dockerfile for data warehouse. Just ~~write this one and to ~~write this one. We do similar here from Python three point 11 HS three 11. I choose three 11 because I use three [00:15:00] 11 in my system. Otherwise we could choose a ~~new ~~newer version. It doesn't matter. ENV DBT profiles, directory is our slash pipeline\\n\\ndeck, db o equals slash warehouse slash job adsb.\\n\\nThese are the environment variables that we send in that we can use ~~them. ~~We'll have work directory is slash pipeline slash orchestration. This is where we will have our work directory inside of our container, and then we'll copy. Our data, we'll copy everything. Now. Our data extract load folder, this needs to be copied into our slash pipeline slash not orchestration, but data extract load, [00:16:00] and then we copy similarly, but we copy the transformation.\\n\\nData transformation. Into our data transformation here, like this. Copy this one, and now we'll copy our orchestration into pipeline slash orchestration like this. Or since we are in pipeline orchestration, we could do like dot. Okay. And now run PIP install. We need to have Dexter. We need to have Dexter dash DBT Dexter dash DLT Dexter dash web server.\\n\\nWe need DBT dash core. We need DBT dash db. We need [00:17:00] TLT. We need Tech db. Okay. And now we will do command. We'll run text there. We'll run dev, we'll run dash F and the definitions. File definitions. Do PI\\n\\ndash h and the host is 0, 0 0 0. A local host. And the port is 3000. Okay, I think we've got it. Lemme just open a new terminal. Okay. I will ~~re ~~remove this data warehouse here. ~~This the duct B here, ~~since we have bind mounted. ~~We have done this docker compose here. We have bind mounted this.data, wear ~~this data warehouse folder to this data warehouse.\\n\\nWhatever ends up in the inside of the container inside of [00:18:00] this data warehouse folder in the container it will end up here. In this data warehouse as well. That is the idea. Okay, now let's go into ls. We'll see our docker compose, ? Docker compose app dash D. Okay. It's installing a lot of things.\\n\\nFirst time for this other image. With Docker Compose here, we have two services. We have two. Containers running. We have one that is data warehouse pipeline and one that is our dashboard.\\n\\nYes, it takes a little bit of time. The first time,\\n\\nyeah, I can close this down and wait until it's finished.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-4:** Okay, let's open up the browser to look into our~~ local host 3000. ~~Local host 3000. And you can see it works. However, there's some failure here. ~~Assets ~~we cannot see any assets reload definitions. Just to check out and we get an error [00:19:00] message here. What is the issue? It cannot find the dbt.\\n\\nThis profiles director, it cannot be found. ~~And the, that, ~~the problem is that I forgot to change a few things. We need to set those now. First in our definitions file here, we need to update a few things. We need to update let's see here. ~~We need to have a d ~~This is the DB path, ?\\n\\nWe'll have\\n\\nremove this one and we'll have here duck DB path. Equals to os Get E nv. We need to pick our duck DB path and then we'll need to have our DBT profiles. Directory equals to os. Get NV DBT profiles [00:20:00] dear, because remember here. We send in our DBT profiles directory. We send in our duck DB path environment variables.\\n\\nThen we need to import os. Okay? We get these things in our definitions files. Let's see. Is there something else that I have forgotten?\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-5:** take a look into this. We have DBT profiles DI did. ~~We take a look into DBT profiles. Did you can see ~~Yes, it is here. Good. ~~We have let's see. ~~We need to put in, in our DBT project, actually, DBT project~~ let's see. Project, yeah. ~~DBT, project director here, DBT project. ~~Let's see. ~~It's the DBT project and here we have project directory.\\n\\nAnd here you see we have profiles. Di did. This is not correct anymore. We'll remove this one and instead here we'll have our~~ pro DT, let's see, ~~DBT profiles there. Okay, this is [00:21:00] very important. And also here in the destination, here we have ~~DDB path, ? ~~DDB Path. Now this should work in our docker containers.\\n\\nSoon we'll actually go into our profiles as well. Let's go into our profiles. Open slash dot dbt slash profiles yaml. Here you can see there's a DBT Duck db. ~~This is we will do like this. ~~We'll change this to ~~DBT Duck db. Actually, we can still have it here, it doesn't matter. But I will change it here.~~\\n\\nDBT Duck db Docker Local. And here we'll have Targets Dev, outputs Dev, and we'll have type db. We'll have the path and the path here. Let's pick that from our environment variable. ~~Enver ~~environment variable, and we'll pick Duck DB [00:22:00] under score path. Yeah, we don't need to install formatter for that.\\n\\nYes. This DVTD DB Docker Local, as you can see this is taking the environment variable, that DB path, which we have set and sent ~~in our, when we ~~in our docker file. I'll close this profiles yaml. And now we just need to do like this let me see in transformations. DBT project at yaml.\\n\\nHere, we need to change this one that it points towards the correct one. Docker local. Save this one. Okay. ~~Don't ~~don't mind the red. It's just the editor that has problem. Okay. Let's do Docker. Compose down.\\n\\nDocker Compose app dash D. Okay.\\n\\nAnd now let's go into our browser. Reload this one. [00:23:00] Let's see. Go into our assets, reload definitions. Okay, there is still an error. Let me just close this one down. Go into browser again. Local host 3000. Yeah, there's still an error here. Let me debug and come back.\\n\\n**Kokchun Giang-6:** Okay, with some debugging, I have managed to find the problem. ~~Here. We have here ~~I forgot this path here, but~~ we add, ~~I add this path that we have the path to DBT Profiles, directory and also remember in DBT project at yaml, we point towards DBT Duck DB Docker local. ~~And ~~and then when you have done the changes, you also need to do docker, compose down to close down everything, close down the containers, and then docker, compose up dash D.\\n\\nBut that is not enough because if the images already [00:24:00] existed ~~and, ~~and even if you change files, it'll just pick the old images, you can't force it to build dash build. When you run this one, it will run for a while and then afterwards it should work. For me, I've already done that.\\n\\nI will just do docker compost app dash D. Now if I do Docker PS, you can see that I have two containers. I have the data pipeline here, and I have this. Dockerized Data pipeline dashboard. Then we can go ~~into browser and ~~into the browser. The local host 3000. And here you can see this is my Dexter.\\n\\nLet's go into the assets. And you can see it has been loaded perfectly. ~~Okay? ~~View, lineage, it works, and we can materialize all. Then when it's materializing, you can see that this one will run here now, and then ~~this ~~this three will subsequently run. ~~Okay. ~~After we do this, you can see in our VS code that we will get back our job ads tech db, our [00:25:00] data will go there.\\n\\nWe'll go into the browser and you can see it's finished materializing, and then we can go into locals 85 0 1 and you can see the streaming dashboard works. ~~Okay, this this is how it worked. ~~We have managed to dockerize our pipeline and dockerize our dashboard.\\n\\nOkay, in this video you've seen me working with Docker to containerize both the data pipeline and ~~to containerize the ~~the dashboard into two different services using Docker Compose. And~~ they were connecting to ~~they were pointing to two different Docker files. That is quite cool.\\n\\nAnd~~ you, ~~you can see that it worked locally. The next step is to use this and push it to Azure. Azure Container Registry, and then connect it ~~towards an ~~to a web app. That will be really cool and I hope that you'll follow along and learn a lot more. Thank you for watching this video and see you in the next one.\\n\\nBye.\\n\\n\""
